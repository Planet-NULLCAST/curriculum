# 🙌 Contributing to Curriculum

From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is appreciated and welcomed. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change the API please create an issue first. This way we can ensure your work is not in vain.

# Where to add content and how it works?

There is a website [readme](https://github.com/Planet-NULLCAST/curriculum/blob/main/HOW_TO_ADD_CHAPTER.md) file which lists out how the curriculum is structured and which files need to be updated for adding content

# Steps for contributing

 Switch to [`development`](https://github.com/Planet-NULLCAST/curriculum/tree/development) branch before start working as it has the latest code

1. Create or pick an issue from the [issues](https://github.com/Planet-NULLCAST/curriculum/issues)
2. If adding a new feature create an issue with lots of details to support. You can even start a discussion [here](https://github.com/Planet-NULLCAST/curriculum/discussions) to gain upvotes or ask for improvising the idea.
3. For a member create a branch and send PR
4. The contributions guide is generally [forking and pull request](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) for outside collaborators

Happy hacking
