I love Bootstrap because it solves a problem that I have. I'm not good at designing web app user interfaces. That is why I made this Bootstrap tutorial for beginners.

As proof, you will see that we are using Bootstrap in most of our tutorials. Here are some good looking websites or web apps built with the help of Bootstrap: http://expo.getbootstrap.com

1.0 INCLUDE BOOTSTRAP VIA CDN
We will use a CDN or Content delivery network to enable Bootstrap on our page.

Using Bootstrap CDN means that we will not download and store the bootstrap files in our server or local machine. We will just include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript links on our web page.

Create new index.html file. Open the file, place the following code and save it.
