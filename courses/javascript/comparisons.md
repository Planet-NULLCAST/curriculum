We know many comparison operators from maths.

In JavaScript they are written like this:

- Greater/less than: `a > b`, `a < b`.
- Greater/less than or equals: `a >= b`, `a <= b`.
- Equals: `a == b`, please note the double equality sign `==` means the equality test, while a single one a `=` b means an assignment.
- Not equals. In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as `a != b`.

All comparison operators return a boolean value:

- `true` – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”.
- `false` – means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”.

### Example

```javascript
alert(2 > 1); // true (correct)
alert(2 == 1); // false (wrong)
alert(2 != 1); // true (correct)
```

A comparison result can be assigned to a variable, just like any value:

```javascript
let result = 5 > 4; // assign the result of the comparison
alert(result); // true
```

## String Comparison

In javascript, strings can also be compared. Strings are compared letter by letter. Note that cases are also compared. Lowercase values are greater than Uppercase, don't ask why ;)

```javascript
alert( 'Z' > 'A' ); // true
alert( 'Glow' > 'Glee' ); // true
alert( 'Bee' > 'Be' ); // true
}
```

## Comparison of different types

```javascript
alert( '2' > 1 ); // true, string '2' becomes a number 2
alert( '01' == 1 ); // true, string '01' becomes a number 1
}
```

In the example above, for comparison, string '2' is typecasted to number 2 and then compared with number 1. However, `alert( '01' === 1 );` returns `false`. This is because `===` is the strict comparison operator, which compares the type of the operands too.

## `undefined`, the incomparable

The value undefined shouldn’t be compared to other values:

```javascript
alert(undefined > 0); // false (1)
alert(undefined < 0); // false (2)
alert(undefined == 0); // false (3)
```

We get these results because:

- Comparisons (1) and (2) return `false` because `undefined` gets converted to `NaN` and `NaN` is a special numeric value which returns `false` for all comparisons.
- The equality check (3) returns `false` because `undefined` only equals `null`, `undefined`, and no other value.

## Complete the tasks below:

What will be the result for these expressions?

- Use all the methods in chapter one to display the output of below comparisons [refer here..](hello-world)

  - 5 > 4
  - "apple" > "pineapple"
  - "2" > "12"
  - "2" > 12
  - 5 > undefined
